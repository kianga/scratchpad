# Scratchpad

This is a simple HTML/JS-based tool for counting characters and words.

Enter your text and see the number of characters and words at the bottom. You can also select text to count only within the selection.

Text is auto-saved in your browser's local storage, so nothing gets lost if you close the page by accident. Keep this in mind if you enter sensitive data.
